## Release Audit

Build the audit from local and user-authorized evidence. Do not run unpinned
remote code, upload repository contents to third-party services, or call
external scanners unless the user explicitly approves that specific tool and
data flow.

Use this order:

1. Establish the release surface.
2. Read recent changes and current branch state.
3. Inspect runtime, auth, data, payment, background-job, AI, and deployment
   boundaries that actually exist in the repo.
4. Check CI, tests, migrations, environment documentation, and rollback path.
5. Produce a short ship/block recommendation with specific fixes.

Start with cheap, local signals:

```text
git status --short --branch
git log --oneline --decorate -20
git diff --stat origin/main...HEAD
```

Then inspect the project-specific surface:

- Package scripts, CI workflows, release scripts, Docker files, and deployment
  manifests.
- API routes, webhooks, auth middleware, background workers, cron jobs, and
  database migrations.
- Environment variable documentation and startup checks.
- Observability hooks, error reporting, logs, health checks, and dashboards.
- Rollback, seed, migration, and backfill instructions.
- E2E coverage for the user paths that matter most.

## Scoring

Use scores to force prioritization, not to imply mathematical certainty.

| Band                    | Score  | Meaning                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Blocked                 | 0-49   | Do not ship until the top risks are fixed          |
| Risky                   | 50-69  | Ship only behind a small rollout or internal beta  |
| Launchable With Caveats | 70-84  | Ship if owners accept the listed risks             |
| Strong                  | 85-100 | No obvious launch blockers from available evidence |

Cap the score at `69` if any of these are true:

- Authentication or authorization is missing on sensitive data.
- Payment or fulfillment webhooks are not idempotent.
- Required migrations cannot be run safely.
- Secrets are exposed in client bundles, logs, or committed files.
- There is no rollback path for a high-impact release.

Cap the score at `84` if CI is not green or the launch-critical path was not
tested end to end.

## Output Format

Lead with one sentence:

```text
Production audit: 76/100, launchable with caveats, with webhook idempotency and rollback docs as the two risks to fix before public launch.
```

Then list:

- `Blockers`: must-fix items before deploy.
- `High-value fixes`: next fixes if the user wants to improve the score.
- `Evidence checked`: files, commands, CI, deployed URL, or PRs inspected.
- `Evidence missing`: what would change confidence if provided.
- `Next action`: one concrete fix or verification step.
